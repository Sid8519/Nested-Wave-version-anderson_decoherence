A Nested Wave Model for Quantum Non-locality: Reconciling with Special Relativity

By Sidney H Belzberg and Alicia Belzberg, Marc Rendell,Eleftherios Gkioulekas

Abstract
We propose a nested wave model to address this nonlocal behavior without abandoning the fundamental principles of relativity. Our model introduces a hidden wave structure (Wave 2) interacting with conventional wavefunctions (Wave 1). As entangled particles separate by significant distances, new nested wave structures emerge within Wave 2 to mediate seemingly non-local entanglement effects. Importantly, quantum decoherence, increasing with distance, could disrupt the coherence of the Wave 2 structures. Decoherence introduces increasing "noise" into the Wave 2 system, potentially causing a delay as the entanglement signal must overcome this disruption over increasing distances. Rather than hindering entanglement, this disruption offers a potential mechanism for explaining a minuscule delay in the observed non-locality..

Mathematically, we model this process with a modified Schrödinger equation containing nested terms whose interactions scale as a function of separation distance and entanglement severity ('η'). Additionally, we introduce an exponential decoherence term, dependent on distance ('d'), to account for the potential degradation of nested wave interactions. We include a theoretical limit informed by the speed of light as a critical threshold for generating new nested wave structures:
i∂Ψ(x,t) / ∂t = [−ℏ² / 2m ⋅ ∇² + V(x) + Σ{ki f(η, ai(d), c) Φi(x,t)} + β  e^(-kd)  Ψ(x,t)] Ψ(x,t)
Here, 'c' is a proxy for the speed-of-light limit in nested wave generation dynamics. Individual nested waves ('Φi') possess scale factors ('ai') exhibiting distance ('d') and entanglement dependency through 'f(η).' Notably, the inclusion of parameter 'c' directly reflects the model's focus on a nested wave system that respects relativistic constraints for each interacting level within Wave 2.


While Wave 2 was initially conceptualized as a general hidden wave structure, the model allows for further exploration. We propose that individual nested waves (Φi) within Wave 2 might resemble Quantum Harmonic Oscillators (QHOs). These QHO-like structures possess quantized energy levels, potentially explaining discrete changes in entanglement behavior over long distances.
The modified Schrödinger equation reflects this QHO influence with the addition of a term inspired by the QHO potential energy function:
iℏ ∂Ψ(x,t) / ∂t = [−ℏ² / 2m ⋅ ∇² + V(x) + Σ{ki [f(η, ai(d), c) Φi(x,t) + ½ k' d² Φi²(x,t)]} + β e^(-kd) Ψ(x,t)] Ψ(x,t)
Here, the term "½ k' d² Φi²(x,t)" represents the QHO-inspired contribution. "k'" is a constant analogous to the spring constant in a QHO, and "d" is the separation distance between entangled particles. This term suggests that the interaction between Wave 1 (Ψ) and the nested waves (Φi) influences the energy landscape within Wave 2, leading to potential quantization.

This model aims to provide a mathematically sound approach to understanding entanglement within the constraints of Special Relativity. This novel nested wave paradigm opens new avenues for investigating a model that explains non-locality within the context of respecting special relativity, hence offering a complete standard model.
We propose a lab-scale experiment to test this model. Entangled photons will be measured at two distances with high-precision atomic clocks, seeking a consistent but minuscule delay in correlation times at the further distance. If observed consistently, this infinitesimal delay supports our nested wave hypothesis. Conversely, the absence of a consistent subtle infinitesimal delay would corroborate the instantaneous action-at-a-distance interpretation of the Standard Model.


Introduction:

Quantum entanglement, the mysterious correlation between distant particles, has been a subject of intense research and debate since its discovery. The standard model of quantum mechanics, based on the concept of superposition, describes entanglement as an instantaneous, unmediated connection between particles, leading to the paradoxical concept of "spooky action at a distance." However, recent experimental evidence from the Micius satellite experiment challenges this view and supports the idea of a communication mechanism between entangled particles that can be disrupted by environmental factors. This evidence aligns more closely with a pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics, which offers a deterministic and realistic description of quantum phenomena.

The Micius satellite experiment (Yin et al., 2017) demonstrated quantum entanglement distribution over a distance of 1,200 kilometers. The experiment revealed the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the entangled photons, suggesting the presence of a communication mechanism between the particles that can be disrupted by external factors. This observation challenges the standard model's assumption of instantaneous, unmediated communication and supports the idea of a physical mechanism underlying entanglement, akin to the pilot wave interpretation.

Our nested wave model proposes a communication mechanism between entangled particles that is subject to decoherence and can be influenced by the environment. The model introduces a hidden wave structure (Wave 2) that interacts with the conventional wavefunction (Wave 1) and mediates the entanglement process. As the distance between entangled particles increases, the decoherence effects become more pronounced, leading to a reduction in the number of detectable entanglement events and a potential delay in the observed correlations.

The concept of decoherence, which was first introduced in the 1970s by physicists such as Heinz-Dieter Zeh, Wojciech Zurek, and Erich Joos, proposes a gradual process rather than an instantaneous collapse of the quantum superposition. Decoherence theory suggests that the interaction between a quantum system and its environment leads to a gradual loss of coherence over time, causing the system to evolve from a pure quantum state to a mixed state. 

This gradual nature of decoherence has been supported by numerous experimental observations and is a key feature of the theory.
In the context of quantum entanglement, the decoherence theory implies that the entangled state of two particles would gradually degrade as the particles interact with their environment, leading to a loss of entanglement over time and distance. This gradual degradation is consistent with the observed decrease in entanglement detection in experiments like the Micius satellite.

The evidence from the Micius satellite experiment aligns with the predictions of our nested wave model and provides empirical support for the existence of a communication mechanism that can be disrupted by environmental factors. This challenges the notion of superposition and instantaneous, unmediated communication between entangled particles, as implied by the standard model. Instead, it favors a pilot wave interpretation, where a physical mechanism guides the behavior of entangled particles.

The pilot wave interpretation, originally proposed by Louis de Broglie and later developed by David Bohm, suggests that particles are guided by a hidden wave function that determines their trajectories. This interpretation offers a deterministic and realistic description of quantum phenomena, including entanglement. The idea of a hidden wave structure mediating the entanglement process, as proposed in our nested wave model, aligns with the pilot wave interpretation.

It is important to note that the pilot wave interpretation and our nested wave model do not contradict the influential work of John Stewart Bell, particularly his famous Bell's theorem. Bell's theorem dealt a significant blow to the idea of local hidden variables as a possible explanation for the apparent non-locality of quantum entanglement. However, our nested wave model, by proposing a non-local communication mechanism mediated by the hidden wave structure, is consistent with the implications of Bell's theorem.

Furthermore, it is essential to address the inapplicability of relativistic time dilation in explaining the observed non-local behavior of entangled particles. Time dilation, a consequence of special relativity, relates to the relative motion between reference frames and affects the passage of time. However, the instantaneous correlation between entangled particles, regardless of their spatial separation, defies the constraints of special relativity and cannot be explained by time dilation alone.

Attempting to use time dilation to describe the non-local behavior of entangled particles would be akin to comparing apples and oranges. The motion of particles, governed by special relativity, is fundamentally different from the non-local correlation exhibited by entangled particles. Applying relativistic concepts like time dilation to explain entanglement would be inconsistent with the observed instantaneous nature of the correlation.
If our hypothesis is correct, and the Micius satellite experiment reveals, in addition to the observed decrease in entanglement detection, a small delay in the entangled photon correlations due to decoherence of the surviving entangled particles, it could have significant implications not only for our understanding of quantum entanglement but also for the theory of general relativity. The focus on the surviving entangled particles highlights the importance of studying the remnants of the entanglement process, as they may hold crucial information about the underlying mechanisms and the effects of decoherence.

The gradual nature of decoherence, as opposed to instantaneous superposition collapse, aligns well with our hypothesis and the potential observation of a delay in the surviving entangled particles. It supports the notion that the entangled particles can partially withstand the effects of decoherence, and the delay in their correlations would be a manifestation of this gradual process.
General relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, describes the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. The observation of a delay in entangled photon correlations could suggest that the non-local communication between entangled particles propagates through a hidden spacetime structure, implying that the fabric of spacetime itself plays a role in mediating the non-local effects of quantum entanglement.

Furthermore, the delay could provide insights into the nature of quantum gravity, the long-sought theory that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. If the delay is found to be related to the curvature of spacetime or the presence of gravitational fields, it could offer clues about how gravity emerges from quantum phenomena and how it affects the behavior of entangled particles.
Validating our nested wave model, which aligns with the pilot wave interpretation, would also have significant implications for the underlying philosophy of the standard model. The pilot wave interpretation posits that the behavior of quantum systems is fundamentally deterministic, contradicting the probabilistic nature of the standard model's description. If our model is validated, it would support the notion that the apparent randomness and uncertainty in quantum mechanics are due to our lack of knowledge about the underlying deterministic processes, rather than being inherent to reality itself.

Moreover, the pilot wave interpretation asserts that particles have well-defined positions and trajectories at all times, even when they are not being observed. This contrasts with the standard model's interpretation, where particles are described by probability distributions and their properties are considered to be undefined until measured. Validating our model would support the idea of an objective reality that exists independently of observation and challenge the standard model's assumption that quantum mechanics is complete and cannot be supplemented by additional variables.

In conclusion, the Micius satellite experiment provides valuable insights into the nature of quantum entanglement and supports the idea of a communication mechanism between entangled particles that can be influenced by environmental factors. Our nested wave model offers a theoretical framework that accounts for these observations and aligns more closely with a pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics, challenging the standard model's concept of superposition and instantaneous, unmediated communication.

The potential observation of a delay in entangled photon correlations due to decoherence, particularly in the surviving entangled particles, could have profound implications for our understanding of general relativity, quantum gravity, and the fundamental nature of spacetime and matter. It could provide a crucial empirical foothold for developing a more complete theory of quantum gravity and bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and our understanding of gravity.

Furthermore, validating our nested wave model would represent a significant shift in the underlying philosophy of quantum mechanics, supporting a deterministic and realistic view of reality and challenging the probabilistic and observer-dependent aspects of the standard model.
By building upon the foundations laid by the work of Bell, Zeh, Zurek, Joos, and others, and seeking to further explore the non-local nature of quantum entanglement, our nested wave model aims to contribute to the ongoing scientific discourse in the field and advance our understanding of these fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and the nature of reality.

Computational Simulation of Nested Wave Structures Under Decoherence Background and Governing Equation

Anderson localization describes a quantum mechanical phenomenon where disorder within a system prevents the diffusion of particle wave functions, causing them to become spatially localized. This principle is instrumental in our simulation efforts to explore the impact of quantum decoherence on nested wave structures, as described in the nested wave hypothesis.

Computational Model and Framework

Our investigation of the nested wave hypothesis centers on a computational model that simulates how environmental decoherence influences quantum entanglement. We draw inspiration from Anderson localization principles and Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) dynamics. The core of our simulation utilizes a modified Schrödinger equation that integrates nested wave interactions, distance-dependent decoherence, and energy levels influenced by QHO behavior.

Governing Equation

The following equation governs the behavior of our simulated system:
ℏ ∂Ψ(x,t) / ∂t = [-ℏ²/2m ⋅ ∇² + V(x) + Σ{ki f(η, ai(d), c) Φi(x,t)} + β e^(-kd)] Ψ(x,t)

Where:

Ψ(x,t) : System's wavefunction
Φi(x,t) : Nested waves influenced by separation distance (d) and subjected to decoherence effects
m : Mass-like parameter
kᵢ : Spring-like constant
V(x) : Potential energy
f(η, ai(d), c) : Function relating entanglement severity (η), distance dependence (ai(d)), and speed-of-light constraint (c)
β e^(-kd) : Distance-dependent decoherence term
Nested Wave Dynamics

Nested waves (Φi) are modeled using a QHO-inspired wave equation:
iℏ ∂Φi(x,t) / ∂t = [-ℏ²/2mi ⋅ ∇² + ½ ki d² Φi²(x,t)] Φi(x,t)

where:

'mi' represents a mass-like parameter signifying inertia within the quantum system.
'ki' acts as a spring constant, influencing the quantized energy levels of the nested waves.
'd' is the separation distance between entangled particles, impacting the nested wave energy landscape.

Anderson Localization and Decoherence Simulation

We ground our simulation in the Anderson localization model, which highlights how wave propagation can be disrupted in disordered systems. This concept mirrors the environmental impacts we explore on Wave 2 structures in our nested wave hypothesis.  Our simulations incorporate randomness and disorder to study these environmental influences on quantum states.
